0. Install mysql and mysql workbench.
-May need to sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

1. Create a file in the database directory called secrets.py
2. Write the following line in the secrets.py file:
        dbpassword = "<insert root db password here>"

3. Run "python3 setupcsv.py" and follow instructions on top on that python file/
(This step will completely erase existing artwork, so unless you are testing specifically
for this, skip this step)

4. Run "python setupdb.py"
-I condensed everything to one file to make things simpler. The script actually
deletes whe whole database and recreates it.

Then run the django migrations (python manage.py migrate). This will create the auth_user table and several more tables.
You will have to run the migrations every time you run setupdb.py

5. To access the api, you will probably need to insert a couple lines such as the following at the top of your python file:

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '..')                  # Path to Artify directory
sys.path.insert(0, '<path to >/database') # e.g. "../database"
from database.dbutils import DbApiInstance

(See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4383571/importing-files-from-different-folder for more info)

Look at views.py in the art app for an example

6. Check out the custom functions already defined in dbutils before re-inventing stuff from scratch.
