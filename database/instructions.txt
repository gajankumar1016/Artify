1. Create a file in the database directory called secrets.py
2. Write the following line in the secrets.py file:
        dbpassword = "<insert password here>"
3. Run "python setupdb.py"
-I condensed everything to one file to make things simpler. The script actually
deletes whe whole database and recreates it.
