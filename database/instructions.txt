1. Create a file in the database directory called secrets.py
2. Write the following line in the secrets.py file:
        dbpassword = "<insert password here>"
3. Run "python setupdb.py"
-I condensed everything to one file to make things simpler. The script actually
deletes whe whole database and recreates it.
4. To access the api, you will probably need to insert a couple lines such as the following at the top of your python file:

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '..')                  # Path to Artify directory
sys.path.insert(0, '<path to >/database') # e.g. "../database"

from database.dbutils import DbApiInstance

5. Check out the custom functions already defined in dbutils before re-inventing stuff from scratch.
